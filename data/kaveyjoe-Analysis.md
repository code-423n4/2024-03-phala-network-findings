## 1. Introduction
Phala Network tackles a challenge in the world of blockchain technology: limited capabilities of smart contracts. They do this by introducing a new concept - Phat Contracts.
Imagine smart contracts as basic kitchen appliances. Phat Contracts are like powerful workstations that can handle complex culinary tasks, completely transforming what's possible.
Phat Contract Runtime is a core component of the Phala Network, acting as a coprocessor for blockchains. It tackles limitations of existing blockchains by offloading complex computations to a secure off-chain environment. This enhances efficiency, scalability, and security for decentralized applications (dApps).This report analyzes Phat Contracts, exploring their functionalities, codbase analysis,Phat contract Runtime workflow , Economic Model Analysis , Archtectural business logic, Representation of risk model,Risk & Challenges,Area of Improvements and Overall Architecture recommendations  .















## 2. Protocol Overview
The Phat Contract Runtime  facilitates secure and verifiable off-chain computation for blockchains. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their interactions:

**1. Phat Contracts**
- Represent programs written in a language specifically designed for Phat Contracts.
- Define the logic and computations to be executed off-chain.
- Can interact with the main blockchain through designated methods for data retrieval and manipulation.

**2. Worker Nodes**
- Act as the off-chain execution environment.
- Equipped with Trusted Execution Environments (`TEEs`) like Intel SGX for secure enclaves.
- Execute Phat Contracts within these secure enclaves, isolating them from the main worker node environment.

**3. Blockchain**
- Serves as the main ledger for the network, storing application state and transaction history.
- Interacts with Phat Contracts through pre-defined interfaces for data access and manipulation.
- Verifies the results of off-chain computations using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (`ZKPs`) provided by worker nodes.

**4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
- Employed by worker nodes to prove the correctness of off-chain computations.
- Allow worker nodes to demonstrate completion of computations without revealing the actual data processed.
- This ensures privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information within the Phat Contract.

**5. Smart Contracts (Optional)**
- Can be deployed on the main blockchain to interact with Phat Contracts.
- Trigger the execution of Phat Contracts by passing necessary data and parameters.
- Receive results and proofs from Phat Contracts after off-chain execution.
- Facilitate integration of Phat Contracts with existing blockchain applications.

- ### Key Components


**Privacy-preserving** 
- Phat Contracts allow developers to build privacy-preserving decentralized applications (DApps) by leveraging the privacy features of the Phala Network. By combining secure enclaves, such as Intel `SGX`, with the Substrate blockchain, Phala Network ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data and computation.

**Scalability**
- Phat Contracts offer improved scalability through off-chain computation, leveraging the TEE (`Trusted Execution Environment`) and secure multi-party computation (`sMPC`) techniques. This reduces the load on the main blockchain, allowing for more transactions per second `(TPS`) and lower fees.

**General-purpose WASM environment**
- Phat Contracts use a general-purpose WASM environment for contract development, making it easy for developers familiar with Rust or other `WASM-compatible` languages to write and deploy contracts.

**Interoperability**
- Phat Contracts are built on the Substrate `framework`, which provides compatibility with the Polkadot ecosystem. This enables developers to create and deploy cross-chain decentralized applications (DApps) and leverage the full potential of Phala Network's privacy-oriented features.

- ### 2.2 Components and functionalities of Phat Contracts

- **Phala Chain**: A specialized Substrate blockchain that manages contracts, governance, and shared state among parties running secure enclaves.

- **Secure Enclaves (TEEs)**: Phala Network leverages secure enclaves, specifically Intel SGX, to provide isolated environments for contract execution. This ensures confidentiality and integrity of the computation and data.

- **sMPC**: Secure multi-party computation is used with secure enclaves to coordinate and combine encryption, reducing the computational load on individual enclaves while preserving privacy requirements.

- **Chain Extension**: Chain Extension allows the Phala chain to offer additional functionality to contracts through native OS calls (OCALLs). This provides an interface between contracts and the underlying blockchain and secure enclave.

- **C API**: Phala Network provides a C API for contract development, enabling developers to deploy and interact with contracts in a WebAssembly (WASM) environment. The C API includes type definitions, structs, and functions for contract management and communication.

- **Local Cache**: A local cache module is used to optimize contract storage and reduce external storage calls, improving performance and decreasing interaction costs between the contract and the blockchain.



- ### How Contracts Work in the Phala Network?

- **Smart Contracts**: Phala Network supports WebAssembly (`WASM`) based smart contracts, often referred to as Phat Contracts. The network utilizes the Contracts pallet as a foundation for deploying, executing, and managing these contracts.

- **Contracts Pallet**: The Contracts pallet is responsible for handling various aspects of the contract lifecycle. Key functionalities of the Contracts pallet include deploying, instantiating, calling, and destroying contracts. The pallet also manages contract storage and handles associated events and errors.

- **CAPI (Contract Abstraction Interface)**: `CAPI` is an abstraction layer that provides a standardized way of working with contracts. It consists of Entry Calls (`ECALLs`) and Outside Calls (OCALLs). ECALLs are used to invoke contract functions, while `OCALLs` allow system calls from contracts with the help of a dedicated system module. CAPI simplifies interaction with smart contracts and serves as a bridge between the runtime and the contract layer.

- **PhalaWorker Pallet**: This pallet handles worker registration and scheduling. It is designed to manage Phala workers and their associated tasks within the network.

- **Storage**: Phala Network supports on-chain storage as well as external storage for contracts. External storage is primarily used for storing contract data, allowing for better storage scalability solutions. Phala uses sr25519 as the default signature scheme for data storage.

- **Phala Chain Extension**: The chain extension is a primary component of the Phala Network runtime. The chain extension is used to support WASM-based contracts and provides functionality for extending the runtime's functionality outside the `FRAME` system.

- **Local Cache**: This is a local cache mechanism implemented within the chain extension. It helps improve contract execution performance by storing frequently accessed data, reducing the need for external storage lookups.

- **Versioning**: Phala has a versioning system for contracts. Version 1 of the `CAPI` is currently in use and includes relevant types and functions used during contract execution.

- **Security**: Phala Network uses a unique security mechanism that combines confidential computing, secure enclaves (`TEEs`), and a two-way multi-party computation (`MPC`) protocol to ensure secure and private execution of smart contracts. Phala runs contracts inside enclaves, which ensures data confidentiality and integrity.

- **Execution Environment**: Phala contracts execute in a WebAssembly environment optimized for efficient execution, which provides strong isolation and security guarantees.

The Phala contract runtime is composed of several modules that work together to provide a secure and efficient environment for executing smart contracts. The main contract functionality is implemented in the `pallet_pink module` [src/runtime.rs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-phala-network/blob/main/phala-blockchain/crates/pink/runtime/src/runtime.rs), which provides a set of APIs for deploying, invoking, and managing smart contracts.

The `pallet_pink` module uses the Contract type from the [storage module](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-phala-network/blob/main/phala-blockchain/crates/pink/runtime/src/storage/mod.rs) to store contract state. The Contract type contains the following fields:

- `code`: The code hash of the contract.
- `storage`: The storage root of the contract.
- `data`: The contract data (e.g., the contract balance).
- `admin`: The contract administrator.
- `endowment`: The endowment of the contract.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the contract was created.
- `status`: The status of the contract (e.g., active, paused, or terminated).
- `caller`: The caller of the contract.

The [external_backend module](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-phala-network/blob/main/phala-blockchain/crates/pink/runtime/src/storage/external_backend.rs) provides an interface for interacting with external `storage layers`. Currently, the Phala runtime only supports interacting with IPFS as an external storage layer.

The `pallet_pink` module also provides a set of `APIs` for invoking smart contracts. These `APIs` are implemented in the [extension module](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-phala-network/blob/main/phala-blockchain/crates/pink/runtime/src/runtime/extension.rs) and the [capi module](https://github.com/**code-423n4**/2024-03-phala-network/blob/main/phala-blockchain/crates/pink/runtime/src/capi/mod.rs). The extension module provides low-level APIs for invoking smart contracts, while the capi module provides higher-level APIs for invoking smart contracts.

The [chain-extension module](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-phala-network/blob/main/phala-blockchain/crates/pink/chain-extension/src/lib.rs) provides a set of chain extensions that can be used by smart contracts to interact with the Phala runtime. Chain extensions are implemented as WebAssembly (`WASM`) modules and can be invoked by smart contracts using the ext ABI.

The [local_cache module](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-phala-network/blob/main/phala-blockchain/crates/pink/chain-extension/src/local_cache.rs) provides a local `cache` for chain extensions. This `cache` is used to improve the performance of chain extensions by caching their results.

## 9. Representation of Risk Model
### Centralization Risks
- The validator set is limited, and choosing validators fairly and transparently is essential to minimize centralization risks. The `pallet_bab`e and `pallet_im_onlin`e pallets in the runtime could be potential sources of centralization risk if not properly configured and maintained. Ensuring a diverse and geographically distributed validator set could help mitigate this risk.
- The `impl_benchmark_test_pallet!` macro in `pallet_pink.rs` uses a hardcoded number of `10 validators`, which might not accurately reflect the actual number of validators on the network. This could lead to incorrect assumptions about the network's decentralization.



### Systematic Risks
- In `pallet_pink.rs`, the on`_initialize` function calls `Self::do_on_finalize`, which could potentially cause issues if the contract execution takes too long and delays block production. This could affect the overall stability and performance of the network.

- The Substrate framework itself is quite mature and has undergone multiple security audits. However, keeping the framework up-to-date with the latest security patches and best practices is crucial for minimizing potential systematic risks.

- Ensuring proper resource management and limiting the gas limit for smart contracts could help prevent potential network congestion due to poorly optimized WASM modules.




- ### Technical Risks
- Smart contracts in Phala Network are written using the `phala-contract crate`, which depends on the rust-wasm crate. Ensuring secure and efficient WASM module generation is essential to minimize potential technical risks. Reviewing the phala-contract and rust-wasm crates for memory safety issues and other potential vulnerabilities is recommended.
- Ensuring proper handling of sensitive data and secure encryption in the `pallet_pink_primitives` module is crucial to minimize potential data leakage or manipulation.
- In `pallet_pink.rs`, the `call_function_by_hash` function does not properly check the input FunctionHash for correctness, which might lead to panics if an invalid hash is provided. This could be exploited by a malicious actor to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- In `external_backend.r`s, the ExternalBackend struct's `get_trie_node_ref` function assumes that the input `H256` is a valid trie node hash. This could lead to panics and DoS attacks if an invalid hash is provided.




- ### Integration Risks
- The ExternalBackend struct in the external_backend module handles external storage and computations. Ensuring secure communication and data validation between the Phala Network and external systems is essential in minimizing integration risks. Implementing proper access controls and data encryption could help prevent potential `data leaks or manipulation`.
- Ensuring secure integration with oracle services is crucial for smart contract functionality and accuracy. `The pallet_wrapper_oracle` module should be reviewed to ensure secure oracle communication and data handling.
- In capi/mod.rs, the `rinkeby_endpoint` and `mainnet_endpoint` constants are hardcoded and not configurable. This reduces the flexibility of the network and might lead to issues when integrating with different backend services.



- ### Weak Spots and Single Point of Failures
- The ContractHost struct in the extension module is responsible for handling interactions between the Phala Network and the host chain. Ensuring secure communication, proper data validation, and handling potential errors is essential for minimizing potential weak spots.
- The LocalCache struct in the chain-extension crate is responsible for caching chain data. Proper management of cache data and handling edge cases (e.g., cache misses, stale data, etc.) could help prevent potential weak spots or single points of failure.
- In `capi/ocall_impl.rs`, the `ocall_ens_resolver_contract_addr` function uses a string literal to store the ENS resolver contract address. This string literal is then used to call the ENS resolver contract's functions. Hardcoding this address introduces a single point of failure, as any change to the ENS resolver contract address would require updating the code and redeploying the runtime.
- In `local_cache.rs`, the LocalCache struct's cache field has a fixed size of `1024`. This might not be sufficient for all use cases and could lead to cache overflows or data loss. It is recommended to make the cache size configurable or dynamically adjustable based on the system's resources.




## 10. Risk & Challenges

| Challenge                      | Description                                                                                                 | Risk                                                                                                                     | Suggestion                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of input validation      | The execute_call function in the pallet_pink module does not properly validate input parameters, such as the data_len parameter. This could allow attackers to pass invalid data to the contract, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. | Uncontrolled input could lead to arbitrary code execution or contract state corruption.                                 | Implement strict input validation for all contract functions, including the execute_call function.                                    |
| Reentrancy attacks            | The execute_call function in the pallet_pink module calls external contracts without properly preventing reentrancy attacks. This could allow attackers to recursively call the same function in a way that modifies the contract's state before the original call completes. | Arbitrary code execution, contract state corruption, or denial of service.                                               | Implement reentrancy protection using a mutex or other synchronization mechanism.                                                       |
| Integer overflows/underflows | The contract uses integer arithmetic operations in several places without proper overflow/underflow checking. This could allow attackers to manipulate the contract's state by passing invalid input data. | Contract state corruption or denial of service.                                                                       | Use checked arithmetic operations or other mechanisms to ensure that integer overflows/underflows are handled gracefully.                |
| Unchecked memory access       | The contract performs unchecked memory reads and writes in several places, which could lead to security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. | Arbitrary code execution or contract state corruption.                                                               | Use safe memory access mechanisms, such as try_into or try_from, to ensure that memory access is properly checked and validated.         |
| Unsecured storage access      | The contract stores and retrieves data from external storage using raw pointers, which could lead to security vulnerabilities such as data corruption or unauthorized access. | Data corruption, unauthorized access, or denial of service.                                                           | Use secure storage access mechanisms, such as StorageValue or StorageMap, to ensure that data is properly encrypted and authenticated.  |
| Lack of code documentation    | The contract code is poorly documented, making it difficult for developers to understand its functionality and potential vulnerabilities. | Misunderstanding of the contract code could lead to security vulnerabilities or incorrect implementation.            | Document the contract code thoroughly, using clear and consistent naming conventions and comments.                                       |
| Undeclared dependencies       | The contract depends on several external dependencies, such as the parity-scale-codec crate, that are not explicitly declared in the Cargo.toml file. | Version conflicts or other dependencies-related issues could lead to build errors or runtime failures.              | Declare all external dependencies explicitly in the Cargo.toml file.                                                                   |
| Lack of error handling        | The contract does not handle errors properly in several places, leading to potential security vulnerabilities or incorrect behavior. | Errors could lead to contract state corruption or denial of service.                                                 | Implement proper error handling mechanisms, such as try blocks or the Result type, to ensure that errors are handled gracefully.       |
| Lack of test coverage         | The contract code is not thoroughly tested, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities or incorrect behavior. | Incomplete test coverage could lead to undetected bugs or vulnerabilities.                                            | Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure that all contract functions are thoroughly tested.                                |
| Unsafe Rust code              | The contract uses several unsafe Rust constructs, such as raw pointers or unsafe blocks, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities if used incorrectly. | Incorrect use of unsafe Rust code could lead to buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other security vulnerabilities. | Use safe Rust constructs whenever possible, and ensure that all unsafe Rust code is thoroughly tested and reviewed.                   |


## 11. Area of Improvements

- In `pallet_pink.rs`, the ContractCall::new function does not validate the input data, which could potentially lead to issues. Consider adding checks to ensure that the input data is valid.
- It would be beneficial to add access control modifiers to critical functions, to ensure that only authorized addresses can call them. This can help prevent unauthorized access and potential security vulnerabilities.
- In `extension.rs`, there is no check for the length of the input arguments in the call_contract_native function. This could potentially lead to issues if invalid input is provided. Consider adding checks to ensure that the input arguments are of the correct length.
- It would be helpful to add comments to the code to improve readability and make it easier for developers to understand the intended functionality of the contracts.
- In `external_backend.rs`, consider optimizing the storage layout to reduce gas costs.
- In runtime.rs, there is no check for the length of the input arguments in the `contract_call_execute` function. This could potentially lead to issues if invalid input is provided. Consider adding checks to ensure that the input arguments are of the correct length.
- In `capi/ocall_impl.rs`, there is a lack of error handling in the `contract_call_ocall_exec` function. Consider adding error handling to ensure proper exception handling in case of issues.
- In capi/mod.rs, there is a lack of documentation for some of the functions. It would be helpful to add documentation to describe the intended functionality of the functions.
- In chain-extension/local_cache.rs, consider optimizing the storage layout to reduce gas costs.
